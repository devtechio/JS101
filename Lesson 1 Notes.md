# Lesson 1

* with new releases of JavaScript, features are sometimes added, deprecated, or removed entirely
* when using the JavaScript documentation, be sure to check the compatibility charts.


## Git and Github

* make frequent commits to your local repository 
* push code to remote often
* make sure to push all work-in-progress work to the remote repository when asking for help or a code review.   
* it's okay to use a single git repository for all of the assignments.  Make sure to create a new directory for each lesson.
*  do not create a nested git repos within another git repo.
* in web dev projects create sep repos for each project.


## Active Learning 

* no external distractions, including tv and phone 
* take notes
* look up concepts that aren't clear
* try to articulate the concepts in own words
* visualize classroom environment
* some videos may run long, stay focused and active
* review notes after video to makes sure key concepts are clear

## Discussion Forums 

Each lesson has a discussion forum that is accessible via the "Discussions" tab on the lesson's home page, these contain threaded initiated by other students to ask questions about concepts, request code reviews and get help debugging common errors. 

After completing a course assignment, you can request a code review in the lesson discussion forum. 

## Code Review Guidelines

Great way to receive valuable feedback and improve code, students who do this do better on assessments and future courses. 

Guidelines: 
* many projects have **_bonus features_** assignment that are recommended.  To get max value, request a code review on the bonus features assignment. 
* do not submit multiple code review requests at once.

## Study Sessions  

* future career wont be self paced, learning and working alongside others is an important skill to learn.
* eventually will be required to code in front of other people, even to be evaluated, this is common in software engineering interviews and even after accepting a job. 
* launchSchool TAs host several formal study groups each week ranging from  intro content to various assessments.

## Working with JS101-JS109 Small Problems Exercises:

Exercise groups from JS101-JS119 Small Problems should be done concurrently while doing the coursework.  About 10-15 exercises after each lesson.  A couple problems a day. Each small problem should take 10-15 mins each to complete. 

### Difficulty Levels: 

Problems will either be easy, medium or advanced.  To pass the assessment you need to be able to solve problems that have a difficulty level similar to those in the <mark class="hltr-cyan">medium</mark> group.

Some exercises introduce new topics that are not discussed in the course material in order to teach how to find information.  

### Solving Problems: 

PEDAC process: 
:: Understand the:: Problem, Examples / Test Cases, Data Structure, Algorithm, and Code. 

Two objectives:
 PEDA process the problem 
 C code with intent

![![JS101/#^Table]]

For simpler problems, it's often easier to go straight to code, but for problems of certain difficulty, PEDAC actually saves time even though it may seem like a counter-intuitive laborious process. 

### Understand the Problem 

It is tempting to jump to typing out some code, but it's important to resist this temptation and to instead digest the problem to gain a holistic and well-rounded understanding of what the entire problem is asking.  

Quizzes:
* Aren't used to assess in a formal capacity, even when grade is given. 
* open book, use course materials to find answers
* not timed, no need to rush, some are nuanced and contain subtle, important edge cases
* No partial points
* low scores are common, do not get demoralized
* try to understand why specific questions were missed and use that analysis to firm up mastery of the of the material
* quizzes focus on the topics covered in the current lesson, some questions may cover topics from earlier lesson.
* quizzes are blocking, need to take them to get to next lesson/assignment. 

## Quiz lesson 1:
8/9
`NaN` type number so it is a primitive value.
